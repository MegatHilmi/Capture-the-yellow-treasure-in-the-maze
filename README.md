Project name is a capture the yellow treasure in the maze

Capture the yellow treasure in the maze us the AI playing game which are using reinforcement learning in order to control the player. The player need to avoid from collide with wall, red treasure, or green treasure. The player will keep training hundreds of episodes in order to achieve it goal. The game will stop once the player are able to capture the yellow treasure by using the shortest path.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

## Using capture the yellow treasure in the maze

To use capture the yellow treasure in the maze, follow these steps:

```
	1. Download the code from github
	2. Install the prerequisites
	3. Run the code
		- The code will train the agent for 600 episodes
		- To make the training faster, minimize the turtle window
	4. Wait for the code until training finished
	5. After finished training, open the diplay window back
	6. Choose "y" for yes to start the test
```
